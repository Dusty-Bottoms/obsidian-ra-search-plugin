# Obsidian RA Search plugin

**This plugin is not officially supported or endorsed by the RetroAchievements team. It is independently developed by [DesynchVT](https://github.com/DesynchVT).**

# Description
Easily import your [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/) library with various metadata to discover connections and themes between your games.

# Usage
The plugin ships with just 3 easy-to-use commands. **Before you can use any of them**, you must set up your own RetroAchievements username and web API key in the settings. You can find your API key [under your RA user settings](https://retroachievements.org/settings?tab=applications).

## Auto import RA library
**Requires an RA account**

As the name suggests, it imports every single game listed on your RA account. Choose to also import subsets in the settings! Skips already imported games.

You can choose to cancel the import by running `Cancel auto import`. Games added during the import before cancellation will remain in your vault.

## Add game
**Requires an RA account**

Add any game or subset to your notes, whether or not you've played it before!
## Create base
Automatically create a base within Obsidian, automatically showing files in your configured RA notes library. You can customize it from here yourself, it's just to get you going. As a side note, the boxart images used in the base are hosted on RetroAchievements official media host: https://media.retroachievements.org.

## Fetch guides for library
Installs mastery guides for any already-imported games that have one published, without re-running the full import. Useful after a guide is published for a game you added earlier.

# Mastery guides
When a game has a published mastery guide, `Add game`, `Auto import RA library`, and `Fetch guides for library` install a personalized copy alongside the game note at `RetroAchievements/<Title> (<Console>).md`, with achievements you've already unlocked in hardcore ticked off. An existing note at that path is never overwritten, so a guide you've customized by hand stays yours. The game note's frontmatter gets a `guide` property linking to it.

Guides come from a public registry of full-set, progress-neutral guides at `raw.githubusercontent.com/Dusty-Bottoms/ra-guides`. Installing one makes a network request to that host to look up and download the guide; softcore-only readers are unaffected since the guide stays hardcore-safe (softcore unlocks are never ticked). Turn this off with the **Fetch mastery guides** setting, or point **Guide registry URL** at a different registry that follows the same `index.json`/`guides/<id>.md` layout.

Whether auto import includes subsets or not.

## Show RA logo in ribbon menu
Toggle RA logo in ribbon menu. Clicking it runs the `Add game` command.

## Fetch mastery guides
Whether to install a published mastery guide when one exists for an imported game. See [Mastery guides](#mastery-guides).

# Installation
Click the link to install the RA Search plugin: https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/ra-search.

Or, search in the Obsidian Community tab in the settings of the Obsidian app and install it from there.

## Manual installation
### Option A: Install from a release
1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/DesynchVT/obsidian-ra-search-plugin/releases) and download the latest release's `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`.
2. In your vault, open (or create) the folder `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/ra-search/`. The folder names **must** match exactly.
3. Copy the three downloaded files into that folder.
4. In Obsidian, open `Settings -> Community plugins` and select `Reload` (or fully restart Obsidian).
5. Find RA Search in the list and toggle it on.
Obsidian requires `Settings -> Community plugins -> Turn off safe mode` before any manually installed plugin can be enabled. Only install plugins from authors you trust.

### Option B: Build from source
Requires Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and npm.

1. git clone https://github.com/DesynchVT/obsidian-ra-search-plugin.git

2. cd obsidian-ra-search-plugin

3. npm install

4. npm run build

5. Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/ra-search/` and enable the plugin as in steps 4–5 from Option A.
